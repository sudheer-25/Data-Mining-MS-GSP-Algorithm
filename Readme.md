# Implementation of MS GSP Algorithm

MS-GSP is an extension of GSP algorithm which can support multiple minimum supports that is used for Sequential Pattern Mining.

-- Implemented in Python 3.6

-- MSGSP.py is the main file that contains all the code
-- data.txt is the input file that has all the transaction details
-- para1.txt is the file containing the MIS values of each item and support difference constraint(SDC) value.


--Up on providing the Input (data.txt and para.txt) it generates all the possible length frequent item sequences in a text file as output.txt
